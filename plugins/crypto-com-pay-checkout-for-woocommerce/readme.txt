Crypto.com Pay Checkout for WooCommerce. The best way to accept cryptocurrencies.

== Description ==

Crypto.com Pay Checkout is a payment gateway plugin for WooCommerce. The best way for merchants to accept crypto and be paid in fiat or crypto.

Crypto.com Pay Checkout is a feature of Crypto.com Pay, which utilises [Crypto.org Chain](https://crypto.org/chain_whitepaper.pdf) as a high performing native blockchain solution. This enables the transaction flows between crypto users and merchants seamless, cost-efficient and secure.

* Accept cryptocurrency payments (including Crypto.com Coin, Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Ripple and more) from Crypto.com App users and other wallets' users
* Get settled in fiat currency via bank transfer or various cryptocurrencies
* Price your goods in your local fiat currency
* Allow your customers to receive cashback (in the form of Crypto.com Pay Rewards)

= Customer's user journey =

1. The customer checks out his or her shopping cart.
2. The customer chooses Crypto.com Pay as checkout method.
3. The customer sees a new window pop-up with a QR code. The QR code is embedded with the payment information and has to be scanned using the Crypto.com App within 5 minutes.
4. The customer chooses his or her preferred cryptocurrency to fulfil this payment. If the customer chooses Crypto.com Chain Token (CRO), she is entitled to receive some sort of cashback incentives.
5. Once the transaction is approved by Crypto.com Pay, the customer will see a confirmation screen on Crypto.com App, and the fiat equivalent amount will be deposited to the merchant's balance, as seen in the *Merchant Dashboard*.
